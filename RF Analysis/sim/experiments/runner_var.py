"""The independent openEMS runner: it changes model.json into a Touchstone

The runner runs outside KiCad. The plugin starts it as a subprocess, or
you can start it manually:

    python runner.py model.json output_dir

Thus a crash of the solver cannot stop KiCad, and you can test the
simulation without the GUI. The runner imports only numpy, CSXCAD and
openEMS. It does not import pcbnew or wx.

The runner excites each port in sequence. N ports give N runs, which fill

    A lumped inductor makes the FDTD unstable if the timestep is too
    large. On the geometry of validation/run_rlc.py, 1 nH is stable at
    the full Courant step, but 10, 100 and 300 nH diverge to NaN. The
    largest stable factor follows 1/sqrt(L[nH]) over 300 times in L.

    **The MARGIN of that law is not the same on every board**, and
    2026-08-05 measured it on 6 geometries: the mesh preset, the box of
    the element and the thickness of the board.
    `validation/run_stability.py` holds the measurement, and the log of
    that day holds the numbers. The margin runs from 2.7 down to **1.0**,
    and the worst case is a THICK board: the cells at the element grow
    with the substrate, and a board of 6.4 mm puts 1 nH exactly ON the
    boundary. Thus `LE_STAB_MARGIN` divides the law, and the worst
    geometry then keeps a margin of about 1.5.

    The mesh preset alone changes nothing, and that is not luck: the two
    faces of the element box are anchored mesh lines with nothing between
    them, thus the box itself sets the smallest cell of the board as soon
    as the preset becomes coarse. A rule on the FACTOR is tied to the
    same geometry that controls the stability.

    This stays an approximation. Thus `_diverged()` examines the port

    openEMS keeps the "fastest" engine if the caller names no engine, and
    that engine leaves the largest part of the machine idle. The
    multithreaded engine gives one slice of the domain to each thread,
    and it synchronizes the threads at each timestep. Thus the slowest
    thread controls the speed of all the others, and a thread that gets a
    small slice costs more than it gives.

    The count must therefore follow the size of the model. These are
    measurements on an i7-12700K (8 performance cores, 4 efficiency
    cores), in MCells/s:
